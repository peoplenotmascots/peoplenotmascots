        <h1>People Not Mascots</h1>
        <p>People Not Mascots is an indigenous-led group working to eliminate stereotypical "Indian" mascots in Oklahoma public schools, beginning with a Tulsa-based campaign to change the Union R******s, Central Braves, and Webster Warriors.</p>

        <h1>Research</h1>
        <p>The American Psychological Association recognizes the <a href="https://www.apa.org/pi/oema/resources/indian-mascots">scientific research that determined the harmful psychological effects</a> of Indian sports mascots on our Native youth. These studies show what we have already known through our personal experiences- that American Indian and Alaska Native students have a consistent, negative reaction to stereotypical mascots, such as the Cleveland Indians, because these images and names remind Native youth of the limited ways in which others see them, which in turn restricts how they see themselves. Additional research from the Reclaiming Native Truth Project demonstrates how those stereotypes negatively affect the laws, policies, and education of Native American issues on a broad scale. With the rise of youth suicides in our indigenous communities, allowing these stereotypes to be used and displayed at public educational institutions is totally unacceptable. It's time to stop the unconstitutional discrimination against indigenous people and students, and eliminate the mascots. We are real people, not your mascot.</p>
